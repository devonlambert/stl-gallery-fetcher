All cut parts are placed on the print bed as we would print them to save you time.\r\n\r\nFiles contain full OBJ model of the mask, uncut STL parts, and cut STL parts with pin holes for easier assembly.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE \u2013 MOVABLE JAW**\r\nThis update features a completely re-modeled version.\r\n\u2013 The face cover  is now more accurate to the anime version (the manga version can still be printed and will fit the static older version.)\r\n\u2013 The upper handle has an upgraded attachment.\r\n\u2013 Both jaw sections are now color-divided so you can print the helmet in the right filament. No painting is needed!\r\n\u2013 The lower jaw features holes for a rubber cord and a snap-on hinge. This allows you to create a movable jaw!\r\n\u2013 All the pieces (STL and OBJ) are scaled to the same size, which fits the average head as you can see in our photos.\r\n\r\n**Assembly video**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Mgkt7aic9yU\r\n\r\n**SIZE**\r\nAt 100% scale the model\u2019s dimensions are approximately:\r\n**Width** 267 mm\r\n**Length** 973 mm\r\n**Height** 426 mm\r\n\r\nYou can scale the model as you wish but we can\u2019t guarantee that at a much smaller size the model will print well. **Measure files before printing and scale accordingly to your head size**\r\n\r\nOur Chainsaw man Arm Blades:\r\nhttps://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/chainsaw-man-arm-blades-denji\r\n\r\nThis fan-made model was brought to life by 3Demon.

    "description": "A dice box for the distinguished Victorian gentleman or gentlewoman! It sports over 15 gears on the front, top, and sides that turn hypnotically as you open it. This dice box is my own custom design. Nifty wood-grain pattern on the surface makes it look like an aged wood treasure chest, no matter what material it's printed in! It can hold around 30 regular-sized dice. It's kept tightly closed with a classy keyhole clasp. Whether you want to impress your friends with this pinnacle of Victorian engineering or you just want to lug your dice around in a convenient fashion, you'll be the envy of the party with this wicked case!\r\n\r\nBottom of the box is separated into two files: \"Steampunk Dice Box Bottom.stl\" and \"Brass fittings bottom.stl.\" Import them both at the same time into your slicer and you have the full bottom of the box. Do the same for \"Steampunk dice box top.stl\" and \"brass fittings top.stl\" and you will have the lid.\r\nGears are separated into \"front gears,\" \"Left gears,\" \"Right gears,\" and \"top gears.\" You can lay them on the bed and print them in place. Use the pictures in this listing to find out where each gear goes (they have unique patterns to help differentiate them). \r\n\r\nI made this box about 3 years ago and I was new to 3D modeling at the time so please forgive me if it is confusing. Feel free to message me if you have any issues. \r\n\r\nGears may not actually be able to hypnotize people. But you never know until you try.",

    "description": "Introducing \"Power Up Glow\" - Video Game Inspired #FunctionalArt. As a lifelong gamer, I couldn't resist creating this hanging lamp shade that pays tribute to the iconic Power-Up items from our favorite video games. Every time I look at it, memories of thrilling adventures and nostalgic moments flood back, filling my space with a warm and inviting glow. It's not just a lamp shade; it's a piece of art that brings joy and sparks conversations with fellow gaming enthusiasts. I'm thrilled to share this unique and playful addition to my d\u00e9cor, celebrating the wonder of video games in a whole new light. \r\n\r\nYou will need a standard hanging light kit and a little super glue to attach the ?.  I went this route instead of a multicolor print for the time savings.  This method you can have this hanging in your home in as little as 3 hours with a high speed printer.  Dab of glue to each question mark and you're ready to go! \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to hardware, I rely heavily on Bambu Lab 3D printers. My A1 Mini https://rb.gy/uofj5 is a staple in my office, while my fleet of X1C Carbons https://rb.gy/9r2az ensures rapid and high-quality production. \r\n\r\n#LAMPSXCULTS",

To see exactly where to cut, please have a look at this video:**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/TqICdstOHko\r\n\r\n\r\n I highly recommend to spray some kind of lubricant between the moving parts in order to reduce friction, if the mechanism is too stiff. However, if the printer is well dialed in and you get the tolerances right, it works just fine without any post processing or lubricant. I testprinted it with a BambuLab P1S and a Voron 2.4, both without problems.\r\n\r\nThere is also a testprint included to try out the tolerances of the mechanism prior to printing the whole box.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2023.05.04; V2:\r\nReinforced the gear links on the top doors, since they were too delicate for some printers. They are much stronger now\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2023.06.11; V3:\r\nAdjusted some tolerances to make printing easier. Made the gear links thicker in diameter do increase strength\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2024.01.13 - V4:\r\nRedesigned the whole lower gear section and adjusted gear alignment.

Moreover it functions as a dice tower.\r\n\r\nReel: https://www.instagram.com/share/reel/BAC_nz2I0a\r\n\r\n**Cards compartment:**\r\nThe cards compartment measures 70x70x92mm, which means it can take most playing cards as well as sleeved cards.\r\nThe cards compartment can also be divided by inserting up to six card dividers.\r\n\r\n**Card display:**\r\nThe download contains three different versions of the box, with two of them offering the option to display a commander card on the outside:\r\n- sleeved or double sleeved card (max. 67x92x1,2mm).\r\n- Mini Snap Holder hard shell sleeve (max. 69x95x5mm)\r\n\r\n**Dice compartment:**\r\nUnder the iris lid hides a small dice tray, which can be removed to use the box as a dice tower.\r\nThe lid has a clever two stage mechanism, which first releases the clicking lock before opening the actual iris leafs. This makes it possible to fully open and close the lid without any friction when used as a dice tower, but also provides the option to lock the iris leafs when the lid is rotatet back all the way to secure the dice for transport.\r\n\r\n**Dice tower:**\r\nWhen the card deck and the dice tray is removed, the door on the bottom can be pulled out, which also moves  a flap inside the box to ensure, that the dice roll out of the box. The dice door also clicks in the closed position, so it will not fall out by its own.\r\n\r\n**Assembly:**\r\nTo assemble the box, the only thing needed are two pieces of 1,75mm filament which act as the hinge of the lid and the lid flap, you can then also secure the filament pieces with a small drop of CA glue.\r\n\r\n**Assembly-guide on youtube:**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/46yPGfle0ig\r\n\r\nIf you decide to print the multicolor variant with seperately printed color accents, you will also need to glue the different colored pieces together.\r\n\r\n**Dimensions of the assembled box:**\r\n- 89x92x141mm\r\n\r\n**Minimum printbed size:**\r\n160x160x160mm\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2025.04.07:\r\nincreased the thickness of the cards display tray from 0.7mm to 1,2mm.\r\ntherefore added:\r\n- Box_w_CardDisplay_V2\r\n- Box_w_CardDisplay_Supported_V2\r\n- Box_w_CardDisplay_ColorAccents_V2\r\n- Box_w_CardDisplay_ColorAccents_Supported_V2\r\n\r\n-2025.05.06 - V3:\r\n- added a new version of the design, which now allows to use a mini snap card holder (hard shell sleeve) for the display card\r\nIt was tested with Ultra Pro Mini Snap Holders. The holder must not exceed the following dimensions in order to fit:\r\n95x69x5mm\r\n\r\n-2025.05.11 - V4:\r\n- slightly increased the tolerances of the snap card holder compartment to make it easier to print",

To open, start with the side of the slider with the smaller heart cutout. To close, start with the side with the bigger heart.\r\n \r\nThe first few times might feel a little rough, but after few slides, it will start to work smoothly. If your first slider insertion seems very tight, you can try lightly sanding the sides of the slider's runners for better fit.\r\n\r\n**Follow us** here on [Cults]( https://cults3d.com/en/users/KrakDrag/3d-models) and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/krakdrag3d/) to stay updated on upcoming designs!\r\n\r\n**To legally sell PRINTS** of my designs, you can obtain authorization by joining my: [Membership](https://tinyurl.com/KrakDragMembership) \r\n\r\nHappy printing and share your new Zipper Box! \r\n\r\n**Also check out my new design \u2013 \ud83d\udc31 Cute Cat \ud83d\udc31 Mouse Bungee And Cable Holder \ud83d\udd0c:**\r\n[creation cute-cat-mouse-bungee-and-cable-holder]",

As\u00ed que dise\u00f1e mi propia versi\u00f3n.\r\nes necesario? pues no, pero mola un mont\u00f3n!!\r\nclaramente la Gunblade es exclusivamente de exposici\u00f3n, ya que al tener el mecanismo m\u00f3vil la hoja solo se sujeta al cuerpo mediante una varilla de madera de 8mm.\r\nNO ES UN MODELO PARA JUGAR!! Y SI SE QUIERE USAR DE COSPLAY SE DEBE TENER MUCHO CUIDADO!!\r\n\r\nNOTA IMPORTANTE: EL ARTICULO NO TIENE GATILLO Y MARTILLO FUNCIONALES! SOLAMENTE SE PUEDE EXTRAER EL TAMBOR Y GIRARLO PARA INTRODUCIR BALAS!\r\nen un futuro espero poder dise\u00f1ar todo el conjunto funcional :)\r\n\r\n*********Nota: el amuleto que cuelga de la parte trasera de la Gunblade no esta incluido porque compr\u00e9 el dise\u00f1o en Cgtrader.com \r\npero hay archivos gratuitos en Thingiverse :) *********\r\n\r\n***28/5/2021*** ACTUALIZACION!!\r\nHe modificado el cuerpo del revolver para darle mas resistencia al conjunto por si se quiere utilizar la Gunblade para cosplay o por capricho.\r\nlos archivos modificados son los que empiezan por V2:\r\n- cuerpo derecho con refuerzo\r\n- cuerpo derecho sin refuerzo \r\n- mecanismo tambor\r\n- pasador para unir hoja y cuerpo\r\n- nueva versi\u00f3n de la parte final de la hoja con agujero para el pasador.\r\n\r\nNO HE PROBADO DE IMPRIMIR ESTOS NUEVOS ARCHIVOS!\r\nAUN ASI DEBERIAN ENCAJAR BIEN YA QUE SOLO SON PEQUE\u00d1AS MODIFICACIONES DE LOS ORIGINALES.\r\n:)",
