It comes with different inserts, with one of them also being a functional dice tower, please check out the pictures to see the 3 different insert types A,B and C\r\n\r\nTo assemble the box, the only thing needed are two pieces of 1,75mm filament which act as the hinge of the book, you can then also secure the filament pieces with a small drop of CA glue.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to print the multicolor variant (meant for single material printers), you will also need to glue the different colored pieces together.\r\n\r\nA multimaterial 3MF for BambuStudio is included, if you own a multicolor Bambu printer\r\n\r\n**Dimensions of the book:**\r\n- 150x115x55mm\r\n\r\n**Minimum printbed size:**\r\n180x180x180mm\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2024.07.29:**\r\n- added a version of the book with the possibility to print the different accent colors as seperate prints. This is best suited for single extruder printers or to reduce print waste on multimaterial printers. The parts need to be glued together afterwards using CA-glue.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2024.08.29:**\r\n- added icon plates for 12 different character classes. \r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2025.01.12:**\r\n- added \"PageBox_TypeD.stl\", which can be printed instead of the standard PageBox.stl if you want to fit one or two card decks inside the book.\r\n- added \"PageBox_TypeD_Insert_Single.stl\" & \"PageBox_TypeD_Insert_Double.stl\" in the \"Compartments\"-Folder, which can be used with the new \"PageBox_TypeD.stl\"\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2025.03.08:**\r\n- added \"Leather_Inserts_TopBottom_MC_Print\" to the \"MultiColor_Print_Book\"-Folder, which was requestet by some customers.

This dice box is my own custom design. Nifty wood-grain pattern on the surface makes it look like an aged wood treasure chest, no matter what material it's printed in! It can hold around 30 regular-sized dice. It's kept tightly closed with a classy keyhole clasp. Whether you want to impress your friends with this pinnacle of Victorian engineering or you just want to lug your dice around in a convenient fashion, you'll be the envy of the party with this wicked case!\r\n\r\nBottom of the box is separated into two files: \"Steampunk Dice Box Bottom.stl\" and \"Brass fittings bottom.stl.\" Import them both at the same time into your slicer and you have the full bottom of the box. Do the same for \"Steampunk dice box top.stl\" and \"brass fittings top.stl\" and you will have the lid.\r\nGears are separated into \"front gears,\" \"Left gears,\" \"Right gears,\" and \"top gears.\" You can lay them on the bed and print them in place. Use the pictures in this listing to find out where each gear goes (they have unique patterns to help differentiate them). \r\n\r\nI made this box about 3 years ago and I was new to 3D modeling at the time so please forgive me if it is confusing. Feel free to message me if you have any issues. \r\n\r\nGears may not actually be able to hypnotize people. But you never know until you try.",

The OBJ files included can be loaded into Sculptrtis and re-posed/modified to your heart's content. (CTRL + D will de-select all the parts once they're loaded, btw.) The STL accessories can be combined in another program once you have your model posed (I like to use 3dBuuilder for this). The flat plane is included to help you get a sense of where the bottom of the feet should be, just delete it in Sculptris before you export your final build.\r\n\r\nIf you like this kind of thing and want to see more of it, consider supporting us on Patreon.

    "description": "Introducing \"Power Up Glow\" - Video Game Inspired #FunctionalArt. As a lifelong gamer, I couldn't resist creating this hanging lamp shade that pays tribute to the iconic Power-Up items from our favorite video games. Every time I look at it, memories of thrilling adventures and nostalgic moments flood back, filling my space with a warm and inviting glow. It's not just a lamp shade; it's a piece of art that brings joy and sparks conversations with fellow gaming enthusiasts. I'm thrilled to share this unique and playful addition to my d\u00e9cor, celebrating the wonder of video games in a whole new light. \r\n\r\nYou will need a standard hanging light kit and a little super glue to attach the ?.  I went this route instead of a multicolor print for the time savings.  This method you can have this hanging in your home in as little as 3 hours with a high speed printer.  Dab of glue to each question mark and you're ready to go! \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to hardware, I rely heavily on Bambu Lab 3D printers. My A1 Mini https://rb.gy/uofj5 is a staple in my office, while my fleet of X1C Carbons https://rb.gy/9r2az ensures rapid and high-quality production. \r\n\r\n#LAMPSXCULTS",

However, if the printer is well dialed in and you get the tolerances right, it works just fine without any post processing or lubricant. I testprinted it with a BambuLab P1S and a Voron 2.4, both without problems.\r\n\r\nThere is also a testprint included to try out the tolerances of the mechanism prior to printing the whole box.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2023.05.04; V2:\r\nReinforced the gear links on the top doors, since they were too delicate for some printers. They are much stronger now\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2023.06.11; V3:\r\nAdjusted some tolerances to make printing easier. Made the gear links thicker in diameter do increase strength\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2024.01.13 - V4:\r\nRedesigned the whole lower gear section and adjusted gear alignment.

Moreover it functions as a dice tower.\r\n\r\nReel: https://www.instagram.com/share/reel/BAC_nz2I0a\r\n\r\n**Cards compartment:**\r\nThe cards compartment measures 70x70x92mm, which means it can take most playing cards as well as sleeved cards.\r\nThe cards compartment can also be divided by inserting up to six card dividers.\r\n\r\n**Card display:**\r\nThe download contains three different versions of the box, with two of them offering the option to display a commander card on the outside:\r\n- sleeved or double sleeved card (max. 67x92x1,2mm).\r\n- Mini Snap Holder hard shell sleeve (max. 69x95x5mm)\r\n\r\n**Dice compartment:**\r\nUnder the iris lid hides a small dice tray, which can be removed to use the box as a dice tower.\r\nThe lid has a clever two stage mechanism, which first releases the clicking lock before opening the actual iris leafs. This makes it possible to fully open and close the lid without any friction when used as a dice tower, but also provides the option to lock the iris leafs when the lid is rotatet back all the way to secure the dice for transport.\r\n\r\n**Dice tower:**\r\nWhen the card deck and the dice tray is removed, the door on the bottom can be pulled out, which also moves  a flap inside the box to ensure, that the dice roll out of the box. The dice door also clicks in the closed position, so it will not fall out by its own.\r\n\r\n**Assembly:**\r\nTo assemble the box, the only thing needed are two pieces of 1,75mm filament which act as the hinge of the lid and the lid flap, you can then also secure the filament pieces with a small drop of CA glue.\r\n\r\n**Assembly-guide on youtube:**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/46yPGfle0ig\r\n\r\nIf you decide to print the multicolor variant with seperately printed color accents, you will also need to glue the different colored pieces together.\r\n\r\n**Dimensions of the assembled box:**\r\n- 89x92x141mm\r\n\r\n**Minimum printbed size:**\r\n160x160x160mm\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2025.04.07:\r\nincreased the thickness of the cards display tray from 0.7mm to 1,2mm.\r\ntherefore added:\r\n- Box_w_CardDisplay_V2\r\n- Box_w_CardDisplay_Supported_V2\r\n- Box_w_CardDisplay_ColorAccents_V2\r\n- Box_w_CardDisplay_ColorAccents_Supported_V2\r\n\r\n-2025.05.06 - V3:\r\n- added a new version of the design, which now allows to use a mini snap card holder (hard shell sleeve) for the display card\r\nIt was tested with Ultra Pro Mini Snap Holders. The holder must not exceed the following dimensions in order to fit:\r\n95x69x5mm\r\n\r\n-2025.05.11 - V4:\r\n- slightly increased the tolerances of the snap card holder compartment to make it easier to print",

    "description": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nThis was an idea we had for the Mythic Mugs Graveyard Collection, but wasn't able to squeeze in at the time. \r\n\r\nIt's a detailed dice tower that can serve as a decorative diorama on its own.\r\n\r\nThe model has been updated to version 1.2: small adjustments were made to avoid overhang and teeth added to the bottom jaw to help dice staying in place.\r\n\r\nHappy printing! :)\r\n\r\nVisit our shop at https://arsmoriendi3d.com/\r\nOr follow us on https://www.facebook.com/ArsMoriendi3D/",

    "description": "All 3DTechDesigns STLs are protected under Copyright Law.\r\nWhen purchased on Cults3D you have the right to print it for personal use.\r\nTo legally sell prints of my designs a **monthly active** subscription on patreon is required:\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/3dtechdesigns\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**REEL:**\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/DLVZBq5s0-L/?igsh=YzIwdWp2Y2JqZzho\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of testing I am happy to finally release a new mechanical dice tower. What makes this dice tower special, is that it rolls the dice fully automatically by a simple up and down movement of a lever. A platform moves the dice upwards, where they are then dropped back down by a trapdoor.\r\nIt does not matter how quickly the lever is operated because the trapdoor onto which the dice are thrown always opens at exactly the right moment.\r\n\r\n**Assembly:**\r\nThe assembly is great fun due to its simplicity. A large part of the mechanism is print-in-place designs, meaning it comes fully assembled and functional from the print plate. No extra tools or glue are needed because everything is printed.\r\nAs can be seen in the pictures, two versions of the tower are included, one of which does not require the print in place planetary gear, thus reducing the number of printed parts.\r\n\r\n**Assembly-guide on youtube:**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/CQ-179IuEYM\r\n\r\n**Dimensions of the assembled tower:**\r\n- 119x140x133mm\r\n\r\n**Minimum printbed size:**\r\n140x140x140mm\r\n\r\n**Amount of filament needed:**\r\n~400g of PLA",

    "description": "**This is box with a working zipper functioning as a locking mechanism!**\r\n\r\n**The design is 100[%] print-in-place and requires NO supports.** After printing you only need to cut thin strip of plastic between two halfs with knife [(Showed on demo video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lufu7rN2-J4).\r\n\r\n**Package include standard version and with a built-in brim for easier printing.**\r\n\r\n*Update 05.03.24* - Added additional version with looser tolerances, making it easier to print, while ensuring better zipper functionality. \r\n\r\nTo open/close the box, use the attached slider similarly to a real zipper. To open, start with the side of the slider with the smaller heart cutout. To close, start with the side with the bigger heart.\r\n \r\nThe first few times might feel a little rough, but after few slides, it will start to work smoothly. If your first slider insertion seems very tight, you can try lightly sanding the sides of the slider's runners for better fit.\r\n\r\n**Follow us** here on [Cults]( https://cults3d.com/en/users/KrakDrag/3d-models) and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/krakdrag3d/) to stay updated on upcoming designs!\r\n\r\n**To legally sell PRINTS** of my designs, you can obtain authorization by joining my: [Membership](https://tinyurl.com/KrakDragMembership) \r\n\r\nHappy printing and share your new Zipper Box! \r\n\r\n**Also check out my new design \u2013 \ud83d\udc31 Cute Cat \ud83d\udc31 Mouse Bungee And Cable Holder \ud83d\udd0c:**\r\n[creation cute-cat-mouse-bungee-and-cable-holder]",
